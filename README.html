  <h1>JRGrep README</h1>

  <h2>What is JRGrep?</h2>

  <p>This Java application is basically a recursive file finder. You
  can search for files based on their filename, their contents, or
  both.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>The system must have a Java runtime version 1.4 or better
  installed. See
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a> for acquiring
  a runtime environment.</p>

  <h2>Using JRGrep</h2>

  <p>Start the program by invoking the <code>java</code> command like
  so:</p>
  <pre>
java -jar jrgrep.jar
</pre>

  <p>This will launch the program and from there you can utilize the
  graphical user interface to perform the search. The application is
  reasonably intuitable. The file name and pattern text fields expect
  regular expressions. If you are not familiar with regular
  expressions, search the web or read the book &quot;Mastering Regular
  Expressions&quot; by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl. Basically, typing a word
  or phrase will work.</p>

  <h3>Command-line Interface:</h3>

  <p>JRGrep sports a command-line interface, accessible through the
  com.bluemarsh.jrgrep.tty class. Use &#39;-h&#39; to access the
  help.</p>

  <h2>Building JRGrep</h2>

  <p>To compile the program from source code, you will need the JRGrep
  source package and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>.
  With Ant installed and the JRGrep source extracted to the current
  directory, type the following to compile the source code:</p>
  <pre>
ant compile
</pre>
