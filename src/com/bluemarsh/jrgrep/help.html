intuitable facets of this program.</p>

<h3>Pattern Flags</h3>

<p>Regular expressions may contain flags that enable or disable certain
behavior in the regular expression engine. They are enabled using the
special syntax:</p>

<pre>
(?dimsux-dimsux)
</pre>

<p>Letters preceeded by a '<code>-</code>' will turn off the feature.
The flags must appear before the pattern to have an affect. That is,
the pattern "<code>nocase(?i)</code>" will not match NOCASE because
the flag is at the end of the expression. By the same token, this can
be used to some advantage. The expression
"<code>UPPER(?i)NOCASE(?-i)lower</code>" will match either
"UPPERnocaselower" or "UPPERNOCASElower" or any combination of upper
and lower case characters in the "NOCASE" subsequence.</p>

<p>The flags and their meanings are as follows:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Flag</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>d</td>
    <td><strong>unix lines</strong>; only the '<code>\n</code>' character
    is recognized as a line terminator in this mode.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>i</td>
    <td><strong>case insensitive</strong>; enables case-insensitive
    matching. This feature may impose a performance penalty.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>m</td>
    <td><strong>multi-line</strong> mode; in multiline mode the expressions
    <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match just after or just before,
    respectively, a line terminator or the end of the input sequence.
    By default these expressions only match at the beginning and end
    of the entire input sequence.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>s</td>
    <td><strong>single-line</strong> mode; the <code>.</code> (period)
    metacharacter will match line terminators. Normally it does not.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>u</td>
    <td><strong>Unicode case</strong> mode; when used with the
    <code>i</code> flag this performs the case-insensitive matching in
    a manner consistent with the Unicode Standard. By default, characters
    are assumed to be US-ASCII. This feature may impose a performance
    penalty.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>x</td>
    <td><strong>comments</strong>; in this mode, whitespace is ignored
    and embedded comments starting with <code>#</code> are ignored until
    the end of the line.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
